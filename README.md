# LinkedList

Okay with this version of the program, we get the output:

    We have the following 4 items in the is the list.
    Node's data is Dudeo
    Node's data is Smell
    Node's data is 10
    Node's data is 9

However, the program isn't doing exactly what we want. Instead of joined the two lists together, it's adding the elements of the other list in order one be one. This is an O(n) operation where n is the number of items in the second list.
